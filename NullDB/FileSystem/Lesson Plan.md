Objectives:
Why:
- Why metadata is it helpful
- what is some of the data
	- lets us keep track of things like schema version, record version, and for us most importantly it lets us keep track of if it is deleted without special characters.

How:
- cover how "industry standard databases do it" for example Apache parquet 
- null db supports 3 for reasons
	-  html - first htmx native database
	-  json - human readable
	-  proto - binary format space

### Interesting things to learn

##### Performance
HTML vs. Json vs Proto
 - Size on disk
	 - size zipped
 - Read CPU effort
 - Memory

- not record -> not found
