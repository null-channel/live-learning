## What are your goals?
Estimate Effort?
Project amount of time?
calculating complexity

### What is a point? or the point?
- Time?
- Complexity?
- Risk Level? 
- Something else?
- it can be nothing at all.

#### The issue with time
1) if you don't know the problem, do you know how much time it will take?
2) Does everyone work at the same speed? 
	1) for example, I know rust and go, and I can do frontend but I'm slower then others on my team at that.
	2) planning poker does not usually assign the engineer that is going to work on it ether
	3) If it does this becomes a planning session and that is a mess
3) Does everyone have the same understanding of the issue? if not the amount of time is different depending on each person and forcing them to all come to consensus on this means they end up just picking the most knowledgable's quote because they understand it the best and can argue it the best.

#### the issue with complexity
1) do you fully understand the problem? if not how do you even know how complex it is. you might need a meeting before this meeting to really understand its complexity. and if fully understand it is it as complex anymore? but how much time did you spend understanding it's complexity? did you track that?
2) does everyone have the same level of understand of the issue? if not the complexity is different depending on each person and forcing them to all come to consensus on this means they end up just picking the most knowledgable's quote because they understand it the best and can argue it the best.
