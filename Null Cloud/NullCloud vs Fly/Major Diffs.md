1) Fly.io actually works for others
2) the null cloud actually does a lot of what they do, just in a single region
	1) making it work in multiple regions is a hard problem for the future marek
3) fly.io is containers only at this point (so is the null cloud but working on other support)
4) fly.io is cli push driven vs cli pull driven




Fly improvements:
