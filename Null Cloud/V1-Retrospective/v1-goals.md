Provide "just works" and automatic management of infrastructure. Truly make deploying your application as easy as "git push", though optionally being able to leverage "old school" infra would be cool.

### What infra?:
- CPU/Memory - not nodes/vms 
- Simple Security - should be built in, not added on, not paid.
- secure by default
- gitops?

### Servicesless? no cloudless.
- All "as a service" services should "just work" requiring minimal or no configuration to leverage and use.
- gitops?
- work in your datacenter

### Multi Cloud
- Able to run on bare metal, or cloud provider
- ability to "fail over" to the null cloud
- ability to "overflow" to the null cloud
- ability to network across clouds
- "just works" and "easy" service mesh
