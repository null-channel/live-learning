### What I love
- Actually kind of works.
	- networking is lacking right now.
- I like you don't have to worry about crafting a container
- I like the "gitops" part of it.
	- env based off branches
- Liked the reuse of a bunch of stuff 
	- kubernetes
	- istio
	- cilium
	- kpack

### What I hate
- Is a bit of a just slightly more better "fargate"
- after I realized what I built, does not feel innovative
- Going forward feels more like "building a kubernetes operator" then anything else
- So far, nothing is managing hardware and the best I could do is a "slightly better bottlerocket" with yet another kubernetes operator?
- I would really like to make it "single binary install"

## Open questions:
1) What do people want and need?
2) How can we make that better?
3) How do we manage hardware?
	1) How can we make keeping this up-to-date easy?
	2) Security? CVE's?

### Lessons Learned
1) Its a big project
2) Its a really big project.
3) I need to innovate at the base layer
4) building on top of what there was awesome... and not. I had the same tools everyone else did. Innovating with all the same tools is actually kind of hard. To truly be different requires the ability and desire to rethink everything.
