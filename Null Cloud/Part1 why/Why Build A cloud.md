I have said for a while I think the major clouds have stopped innovating. And on top of this we love learning and understanding the challenges in these real world systems. So, Lets build a cloud and learn something new.

So why am I spending the time, money and effort to build a cloud? Well to hopefully innovate on something cool and learn about challenges faced solving the problem of reliably and safely running others code.

Now you might be expecting me to be using as many free resources on one of the major clouds as possible... but would we really be learning the struggles and issues of a cloud provider if we did that? no. no we would not.

So what are we trying to do? What is our goal?

High Level Objectives:

- you write your app, let us take care of everything else
- Pure serverless, pay for cpu, memory, storage, gpu ect per minute, second? of usage.
- Services that "just work" with little to no configuration from you.
- Security standard, not an add on.
- Run on our own servers

Cool, but what does this mean?

Lets look at a demo deployment. This is my twitch alerts, I actually built it in a way where it's able to run as a monolith, and is how we are running it today but my goal is to be able to run it like this.
