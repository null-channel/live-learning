I have said for a while I think the major clouds have stopped innovating. And on top of this we love learning and understanding the challanges in these real world systems. So, Lets build a cloud and learn something new.

Now you might be expecting me to be using as many free resources on one of the major clouds as possible... but would we really be learning the struggles and issues of a cloud provider if we did that? no. no we would not.

So what are we trying to do?

- write your app, let us take care of everything else
- Pure serverless, pay for cpu, memory, storage, gpu ect per minute, second? of usage.


Lets look at a demo deployment. This is my twitch alerts, I actually built it in a way where it's able to run as a monolith, and is how we are running it today but my goal is to be able to run it like this.
